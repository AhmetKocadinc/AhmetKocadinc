## About Me
Hello, I am Ahmet Kocadinç, a Data Scientist / Data Analyst passionate about technology and artificial intelligence. I have completed a 12-month data analysis certification programme and I am currently working on various projects. You can access these projects on GitHub and Kaggle. I plan to distribute these projects soon by making a web application with Streamlit and setting up my own site.

With this knowledge, I have a YouTube channel, where I re-code projects in videos and present them as a fun education. I also present the podcast programme "Data World with Ahmet" on Spotify. This series will be published one episode every 3 days and will last 30 episodes in total.
